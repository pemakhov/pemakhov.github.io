There are a lot of things I'm doing on the web for the first time. After I created my telegram bot hobby project and run it on the virtual private server, I was happy it worked for some time without any issues. But once, I wanted to show it to my friend and was shocked realising it's offline.
I started it as and ordinary node process. Something like `node build/index.js`. I don't know why it crashed. But I knew that I couldn't be confident about this any more.
The PM2 is a tool that can help keep your nodejs apps running. It can restart your processes after the crashed. It is easy to make this tool autostart. Also there are handy monitors.
You can install it with npm. Also it has good documentation.
